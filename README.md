* Maximize Activity: Ensure your node stays online and actively participates in the network to reach the hourly cap.
* Network Uptime is Critical: Downtime or uninstalled nodes will result in point loss.

# Register Dashboard

## ðŸŸ  Node Installation (Chrome Extension)
**1. Login to [Dashboard](https://testnet.openledger.xyz/?referral_code=bdqbx4mw44)**

**2. Install [Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/openledger-node/ekbbplmjjgoobhdlffmgeokalelnmjjc) and login**

> If you already have a Linux VPS without a GUI desktop, you can run extension node by installing Chromium browser: [Install Chromium Browser on Linux VPS](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Linux-Browser)
